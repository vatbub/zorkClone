# zorkClone [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vatbub/zorkClone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vatbub/zorkClone)
This project aims to reimplement the good old nerdy game [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork), parts I, II and III in java. 

*This is not a wrapper*, it's a reimplementation with
- A nice command window (no need for any emulator for a 1980s command line)
- Autocomplete
- A list of commands that you can execute in the current game situation

**Note:** This project has just started so nothing works right now and no downloads are offered at this stage.

## Download
As this project just started, we do not offer any official downloads yet. If you want to try a cutting edge version of the code (still very buggy), you can do the following:
  1. Download the FOKLauncher ([GitHubRepo](https://github.com/vatbub/fokLauncher)|[Download](https://bintray.com/vatbub/fokprojectsReleases/foklauncher#downloads))
  2. Download [those two files](https://github.com/vatbub/zorkClone/tree/master/foklauncher_info).
  3. Open the FOKLauncher and drag the two files into the FOKLauncher-Window
  4. Make sure to check the "Enable Snapshot Builds"-Checkbox or else you will get plenty of errors
  5. Select Zork (the game) or the game editor and enjoy using a completely buggy software :)

While you are waiting for a official release, you might want to try the [original version](https://www.infocom-if.org/downloads/downloads.html).

## Compile
If you wish to compile the project, just clone the repo and run `mvn package` ([Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) required)
